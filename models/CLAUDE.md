# Models Directory - Context for Claude

## Purpose
Contains model weights and configurations for YOLOv8 and RT-DETR models.

## Model Types
- **YOLOv8** - Primary object detection model for malaria parasite detection
- **RT-DETR** - Alternative detection transformer model for comparison

## Training Status (Updated: December 12, 2024)
1. âœ… **YOLOv8 Training ACTIVE** - Multiple training processes running on CPU
2. ðŸ”„ **Data Pipeline FIXED** - Species mapping corrected for proper 6-class training
3. ðŸ“Š **Training Progress** - Real-time monitoring of multiple training sessions
4. ðŸ’¾ **Model Weights** - Will be saved here upon training completion

## Current Training Sessions
- **yolo_classify** - Training on legacy data format 
- **yolo_classify_integrated** - Training on integrated dataset format
- **CPU-based training** - Using device=cpu due to GPU availability

## Important Notes
- All model weight files (*.pt, *.pth, *.onnx, etc.) are **GITIGNORED**
- Only configuration files and .gitkeep placeholders are tracked
- **TRAINING IN PROGRESS** - Multiple active YOLOv8 sessions
