# Performance Evaluation of Multi-Model Deep Learning Approaches for Automated Malaria Detection: A Two-Stage Pipeline Comparative Study

## Abstract

**Background**: Malaria diagnosis through microscopic examination remains the gold standard but faces challenges in standardization and accuracy across different clinical settings. Automated deep learning approaches offer promising solutions for consistent and efficient malaria detection and species classification.

**Methods**: We present a comprehensive evaluation of multiple deep learning architectures in a two-stage malaria detection pipeline. Stage 1 employs object detection models (YOLOv8, YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and RT-DETR) for parasite localization, while Stage 2 utilizes classification networks (YOLOv8, YOLOv11, ResNet18, EfficientNet-B0, DenseNet121, MobileNetV2) for species identification. The pipeline was evaluated on integrated datasets containing four malaria species (P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. ovale, P. vivax).

**Results**: YOLOv8 demonstrated superior detection performance with mAP50 scores ranging from 0.760 to 0.852 across different experimental configurations. RT-DETR showed improved performance after optimization, achieving competitive results with enhanced hyperparameters. Classification accuracy varied significantly, with several models achieving perfect accuracy on specific datasets, indicating successful species-specific pattern recognition.

**Conclusions**: The two-stage deep learning pipeline demonstrates robust performance for automated malaria detection and species classification. YOLOv8 consistently outperformed other detection models, while classification performance was highly dependent on dataset quality and training configuration. These findings support the deployment of automated systems in clinical settings for enhanced diagnostic accuracy.

## 1. Introduction

Malaria remains a significant global health challenge, with 249 million cases reported across 85 endemic countries in 2022 [1]. Despite the availability of various diagnostic tools, microscopic examination of blood smears continues to be the gold standard due to its cost-effectiveness and diagnostic capability [2]. However, manual microscopy faces challenges including operator variability, lack of standardization, and the requirement for skilled parasitologists [3].

Recent advances in artificial intelligence and deep learning have opened new avenues for automated malaria diagnosis. Object detection algorithms, particularly the You Only Look Once (YOLO) family and Real-Time Detection Transformer (RT-DETR), have shown promising results in medical image analysis [4]. These approaches can address the limitations of manual diagnosis by providing consistent, rapid, and accurate parasite detection and species classification.

### 1.1 Related Work

Previous studies have explored various deep learning approaches for malaria detection. Traditional machine learning methods required manual feature extraction and preprocessing [5], while convolutional neural networks (CNNs) demonstrated improved performance through automatic feature learning [6]. Recent work has focused on object detection models for parasite localization and classification networks for species identification [7].
