# Malaria Detection Research - Figures and Analysis

This folder contains all visualizations and statistical analyses generated for the research paper.

## Files Overview

### Visualizations (PNG)
1. **pipeline_architecture.png** - Complete Option A pipeline architecture diagram
2. **detection_performance_comparison.png** - YOLO model comparison (mAP, precision, recall)
3. **classification_accuracy_heatmap.png** - CNN architecture performance heatmap
4. **training_curves.png** - Training loss and accuracy curves
5. **confusion_matrices.png** - Confusion matrices for best models
6. **species_f1_comparison.png** - Per-class F1-scores for species classification
7. **stages_f1_comparison.png** - Per-class F1-scores for life stage classification
8. **class_imbalance_distribution.png** - Test set class distribution (pie charts)
9. **model_efficiency_analysis.png** - Parameters vs accuracy scatter plots

**Note:** precision_recall_tradeoff.png excluded from final analysis - insufficient data points (only 4) and redundant with F1-score figures.

### Statistical Tables (CSV)
1. **comprehensive_statistics.csv** - Overall performance metrics for all models
2. **per_class_statistics.csv** - Detailed per-class metrics for best models

## Usage in Paper
