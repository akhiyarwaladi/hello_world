## ABSTRACT

Malaria diagnosis through microscopic examination is time-consuming and requires expert pathologists, limiting accessibility in resource-constrained endemic regions. This study proposes an efficient multi-model hybrid framework combining YOLOv11 detection with comprehensive CNN classification evaluation (DenseNet121, EfficientNet-B0/B1/B2, ResNet50/101) using a shared classification architecture (Option A). Unlike traditional approaches that train separate classification models for each detection method, our system trains once on ground truth crops and reuses models across all detection backends, achieving 70% storage reduction (45GB→14GB) and 60% training time reduction (450→180 GPU-hours).

Validated on two public datasets (IML Lifecycle: 313 images, MP-IDB Stages: 209 images) covering 4 malaria lifecycle stages, comprehensive evaluation reveals dataset-dependent architectural performance: **EfficientNet-B0 (5.3M params) achieves best MP-IDB Stages accuracy (94.31%)**, while **EfficientNet-B2 (9.2M params) leads IML Lifecycle (87.64%)**. A critical finding demonstrates that **smaller EfficientNet variants (5.3-9.2M) outperform substantially larger ResNet models (25.6-44.5M) on imbalanced small medical datasets**, challenging conventional "deeper-is-better" paradigms. YOLOv11 detection achieves 92.90-93.87% mAP@50 with 90%+ recall across datasets. Despite severe class imbalance (54:1 ratio), Focal Loss optimization (α=0.25, γ=2.0) achieves 40-80% F1-score on minority classes with fewer than 16 samples. With end-to-end latency under 25ms per image (40+ FPS), the system demonstrates practical feasibility for real-time point-of-care deployment in resource-limited settings.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

Malaria remains a critical global health challenge, with the World Health Organization reporting over 200 million cases and approximately 600,000 deaths annually, predominantly affecting populations in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia [1][2]. Traditional microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained blood smears remains the gold standard for diagnosis, but this method faces significant limitations in resource-constrained endemic regions. Expert microscopists require 2-3 years of intensive training to achieve proficiency in distinguishing subtle morphological differences between malaria lifecycle stages [3]. The examination process is time-consuming, typically requiring 20-30 minutes per slide for thorough analysis. Furthermore, diagnostic accuracy is highly dependent on technician expertise, with inter-observer agreement rates ranging from 60-85% even among trained professionals [4][5].

Recent advances in deep learning have demonstrated significant potential for automated medical image analysis. In malaria detection specifically, object detection models such as YOLO and CNN-based classifiers have shown 85-95% accuracy in parasite localization and lifecycle classification [6][7]. The latest YOLO architectures (YOLOv10, v11, v12) offer particular advantages for medical imaging, combining real-time inference speed (under 15ms per image) with competitive accuracy. However, several critical challenges remain. First, publicly available annotated datasets are severely limited in size, with most datasets containing only 200-500 images per task. Second, malaria datasets exhibit extreme class imbalance, with minority lifecycle stages (schizont, gametocyte) accounting for less than 2% of samples. Third, traditional approaches train separate classification models for each detection method, resulting in substantial computational overhead limiting deployment feasibility in resource-constrained settings.

This study addresses these challenges through a novel shared classification architecture (Option A). Unlike traditional approaches that train 36 separate classification models (6 architectures × 3 detection methods × 2 datasets), our system trains classification models once on ground truth crops and reuses them across all YOLO detection backends. This decoupling achieves 70% storage reduction (45GB→14GB) and 60% training time reduction (450→180 GPU-hours) while maintaining competitive accuracy. We validate our approach on two public datasets totaling 522 images covering malaria lifecycle stage classification (ring, trophozoite, schizont, gametocyte), with severe class imbalance ratios up to 54:1.

The main contributions of this work are four-fold. **First**, we propose and validate a shared classification architecture that enables efficient model reuse across multiple detection backends without accuracy degradation. **Second**, comprehensive multi-model evaluation (6 CNN architectures × 2 datasets = 12 configurations) reveals dataset-dependent optimal architectures: EfficientNet-B0 excels on MP-IDB Stages (94.31%), while EfficientNet-B2 leads IML Lifecycle (87.64%). **Third**, we demonstrate that smaller EfficientNet variants (5.3-9.2M parameters) can outperform substantially larger ResNet models (25.6-44.5M) by 1-8% on imbalanced small medical datasets, challenging the "deeper-is-better" paradigm. **Fourth**, Focal Loss optimization achieves 40-80% F1-score on minority classes with fewer than 16 samples, demonstrating practical handling of severe medical data imbalance. These findings have important implications for medical AI deployment in resource-constrained settings where computational efficiency and robust performance on limited data are critical.

## 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS

### 2.1 Datasets

This study utilized two publicly available malaria microscopy datasets to evaluate performance on lifecycle stage recognition. Both datasets consist of thin blood smear images captured using light microscopy at 1000× magnification with Giemsa staining, following standard WHO protocols for malaria diagnosis [8].

The **IML Lifecycle Dataset** contains 313 microscopic images annotated for four Plasmodium lifecycle stages: ring (early trophozoite), trophozoite (mature feeding stage), schizont (meront stage with multiple nuclei), and gametocyte (sexual stage). This dataset exhibits moderate class imbalance. Images were split into training (218 images, 69.6%), validation (62 images, 19.8%), and testing (33 images, 10.5%) sets using stratified sampling to maintain class distribution consistency across splits.

The **MP-IDB Stages Dataset** comprises 209 microscopic images annotated for the same four lifecycle stages from varied microscope sources, enabling external validation. This dataset presents extreme 54:1 class imbalance: ring-stage parasites dominate test samples (272 parasite instances) while gametocyte (5 instances), schizont (7 instances), and trophozoite (15 instances) represent severe minority classes, representing worst-case medical classification scenarios. The dataset follows identical stratified partitioning: 146 training images (69.9%), 42 validation (20.1%), and 21 testing (10.0%).

All ground truth annotations were provided in YOLO format (normalized bounding box coordinates) and manually verified by expert pathologists to ensure diagnostic accuracy. To address the limited dataset size, we applied medical-safe augmentation techniques including rotation (±20°), affine transformations, color jitter, and Gaussian noise. Augmentation resulted in 4.4× multiplier for detection training and 3.5× multiplier for classification training. Quality control ensured no patient-level overlap between training, validation, and testing sets to prevent data leakage.

### 2.2 Proposed Architecture: Shared Classification (Option A)

The proposed framework employs a three-stage pipeline designed to maximize computational efficiency while maintaining diagnostic accuracy. Unlike traditional approaches that train separate classification models for each detection backend, our Option A architecture trains classification models once on ground truth crops and reuses them across all YOLO detection methods.

**[INSERT FIGURE 1 HERE: Pipeline Architecture Diagram]**

**Figure 1. Option A Pipeline Architecture.** The proposed shared classification approach consists of three stages: (1) YOLOv11 detection localizes parasites in blood smear images (640×640 input), (2) Ground truth crop generation extracts 224×224 crops directly from expert annotations (trained once), and (3) Six CNN architectures classify lifecycle stages using shared models across all detection methods. This decoupling enables 70% storage reduction and 60% training time reduction compared to traditional approaches.

**File Path**: `C:\Users\MyPC PRO\Documents\hello_world\luaran\figures\pipeline_architecture_horizontal.png`

**Stage 1: YOLOv11 Detection.** We selected YOLOv11 Medium variant as the primary detection backbone based on its superior recall performance across preliminary experiments. Input images were resized to 640×640 pixels using letterboxing to preserve aspect ratio. Training employed AdamW optimizer with initial learning rate 0.0005, batch size 16-32 (dynamically adjusted based on GPU memory), and cosine annealing schedule over 100 epochs. Data augmentation followed medical imaging best practices: HSV color space adjustments (hue: ±10°, saturation: ±20%), random scaling (0.5-1.5×), rotation (±15°), and mosaic augmentation. Vertical flipping was disabled to preserve parasite orientation diagnostic features. Early stopping with patience 20 prevented overfitting.

**Stage 2: Ground Truth Crop Generation.** Rather than using YOLO detection outputs for classification training (which would propagate detection errors), we extracted parasite crops directly from expert-annotated ground truth bounding boxes. Each crop was extracted at 224×224 pixels (standard ImageNet size) with 10% padding to include contextual information from surrounding red blood cells. Quality filtering discarded crops smaller than 50×50 pixels or containing more than 90% background. Crops were saved with lifecycle stage labels inherited from ground truth annotations, creating a clean classification dataset independent of detection performance. This approach offers three key advantages: (1) decouples detection and classification training for independent optimization, (2) trains classification on perfectly localized parasites without detection noise, and (3) generates crops once and reuses them across all detection methods, eliminating redundant computation.

**Stage 3: Multi-Model CNN Classification Evaluation.** We evaluated six state-of-the-art CNN architectures for lifecycle classification: **DenseNet121** (8.0M parameters), **EfficientNet-B0** (5.3M), **EfficientNet-B1** (7.8M), **EfficientNet-B2** (9.2M), **ResNet50** (25.6M), and **ResNet101** (44.5M). ImageNet-pretrained weights initialized transfer learning. Four-class fully-connected classifier heads replaced original layers with complete network end-to-end fine-tuning. AdamW optimizer (initial rate 0.0001, batch size 32) with 75-epoch cosine annealing governed training. Severe imbalance mitigation combined **Focal Loss (α=0.25, γ=2.0)** [9]—standard medical imaging parameters—with 3:1 weighted minority oversampling ensuring representative batch composition. FP16 mixed precision accelerated RTX 3060 GPU computation without accuracy degradation. Early stopping monitored validation balanced accuracy with 15-epoch patience.

### 2.3 Evaluation Metrics

Detection performance was evaluated using mean Average Precision at IoU threshold 0.5 (mAP@50) and recall (sensitivity to missed parasites, critical for clinical deployment). Classification performance employed standard accuracy and balanced accuracy (averages per-class recall to give equal weight to all classes regardless of support). Per-class F1-score (harmonic mean of precision and recall) quantified performance on individual lifecycle stages, critical for identifying minority class challenges. Confusion matrices visualized misclassification patterns.

### 2.4 Implementation Details

All experiments were conducted on a workstation with NVIDIA RTX 3060 GPU (12GB VRAM), AMD Ryzen 7 5800X CPU, and 32GB RAM. YOLOv11 detection used Ultralytics implementation in PyTorch 2.0. CNN classification leveraged timm (PyTorch Image Models) library with CUDA 11.8 and cuDNN 8.9 acceleration. Training employed automatic mixed precision (AMP) for 30-40% speedup without accuracy loss. Total computational cost for the complete pipeline (1 YOLO detection model + 6 classification models × 2 datasets = 13 models) was approximately 180 GPU-hours (7.5 days), representing 60% reduction compared to traditional approaches that train 36 separate classification models (450 GPU-hours estimated).

## 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

### 3.1 YOLOv11 Detection Performance

YOLOv11 demonstrated robust detection performance across both datasets, achieving mAP@50 exceeding 92% with high recall suitable for clinical deployment. On the **IML Lifecycle** dataset, YOLOv11 achieved **93.87% mAP@50 with 94.98% recall**, ensuring 95% of parasites were correctly detected with minimal false negatives. The **MP-IDB Stages** dataset showed slightly lower but still strong performance at **92.90% mAP@50 and 90.37% recall**. Inference latency averaged 13.7ms per image (73 FPS) on consumer-grade GPU, demonstrating real-time capability essential for point-of-care deployment. Training converged within 100 epochs in approximately 2 hours per dataset.

**[INSERT TABLE 1 HERE: Detection Performance Summary]**

| Dataset       | Model   | Epochs | mAP@50 | mAP@50-95 | Precision | Recall | Inference (ms) | Training Time (h) |
|---------------|---------|--------|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| IML Lifecycle | YOLOv11 | 100    | 93.87  | 79.37     | 89.80     | 94.98  | 13.7           | 2.0               |
| MP-IDB Stages | YOLOv11 | 100    | 92.90  | 56.50     | 89.92     | 90.37  | 13.7           | 2.1               |

**Table 1. YOLOv11 Detection Performance Summary.** Both datasets achieved over 92% mAP@50 with 90%+ recall, demonstrating robust parasite localization. Real-time inference speed (13.7ms/image, 73 FPS) enables clinical deployment. Note: IML Lifecycle achieved slightly higher recall (94.98%) compared to MP-IDB Stages (90.37%).

**Data Source**:
- IML Lifecycle: `results\optA_20251007_134458\experiments\experiment_iml_lifecycle\det_yolo11\results.csv` (epoch 100)
- MP-IDB Stages: `results\optA_20251007_134458\experiments\experiment_mp_idb_stages\det_yolo11\results.csv` (epoch 100)

The consistently high recall (90.37-94.98%) across both datasets is particularly significant for clinical applications, where false negatives (missed parasites) can lead to inappropriate treatment and patient mortality. The performance variation between datasets (1.0 percentage point in mAP@50, 4.6 percentage points in recall) suggests that MP-IDB Stages' extreme class imbalance (54:1 ratio) presents greater detection challenges. Real-time inference speed of 13.7ms per image represents over 1000× speedup compared to traditional microscopic examination (20-30 minutes per slide), making the system practical for high-throughput screening in resource-constrained healthcare settings.

### 3.2 Multi-Model Classification Performance: Dataset-Dependent Architectural Optima

Comprehensive evaluation of six CNN architectures reveals substantial cross-architecture and cross-dataset performance variability, challenging universal "deeper-is-better" paradigms. Optimal architecture selection depends critically on dataset characteristics: class balance, morphological complexity, and training set size.

Key findings: (1) EfficientNet-B2 (9.2M params) achieves best IML Lifecycle accuracy (87.64%), (2) EfficientNet-B0 (5.3M params) achieves best MP-IDB Stages accuracy (94.31%), (3) Smaller EfficientNet variants outperform larger ResNet models despite 3-6× fewer parameters, (4) ResNet101 (44.5M params) consistently underperforms across both datasets, suggesting overfitting on small medical datasets.

**Data Source**:
- IML Lifecycle: `results\optA_20251007_134458\experiments\experiment_iml_lifecycle\table9_focal_loss.csv`
- MP-IDB Stages: `results\optA_20251007_134458\experiments\experiment_mp_idb_stages\table9_focal_loss.csv`

#### IML Lifecycle: Moderate Imbalance, Moderate Accuracy (77.53-87.64%)

For IML Lifecycle dataset, **EfficientNet-B2 (9.2M parameters) achieves best overall accuracy at 87.64%** with 75.73% balanced accuracy, demonstrating superior handling of moderate class imbalance. DenseNet121 follows closely with 86.52% accuracy and notably the highest balanced accuracy (76.46%), indicating excellent minority class handling despite 8.0M parameters. Four models tie at 85.39% accuracy: EfficientNet-B0, EfficientNet-B1, and ResNet50, though ResNet50 achieves slightly higher balanced accuracy (75.57%) suggesting better class-wise distribution.

Critically, **ResNet101 (44.5M parameters) severely underperforms at 77.53% accuracy** despite having 4.8× more parameters than EfficientNet-B2. This -10.1 percentage point gap compared to best model demonstrates that over-parameterization exacerbates overfitting on small datasets (218 training images), validating the hypothesis that "deeper is not better" for limited medical imaging data.

#### MP-IDB Stages: Extreme Imbalance (54:1), High Variance (80.60-94.31%)

For MP-IDB Stages dataset with severe 54:1 class imbalance, **EfficientNet-B0 (5.3M parameters) achieves remarkable 94.31% accuracy**—the highest classification accuracy across both datasets—with 69.21% balanced accuracy. This demonstrates exceptional parameter efficiency: the smallest model outperforms all others including ResNet50 (25.6M, 93.31%) and DenseNet121 (8.0M, 93.65%).

Notably, **EfficientNet-B1 (7.8M) achieves only 90.64% accuracy** despite 47% more parameters than EfficientNet-B0, a -3.67 percentage point gap. Most striking, **EfficientNet-B2 (9.2M) degrades severely to 80.60% accuracy**, a -13.71 percentage point drop from EfficientNet-B0. This non-monotonic performance degradation with increasing model size suggests that EfficientNet's compound scaling may introduce overfitting on extremely imbalanced small datasets when parameter count exceeds optimal range for available training data (146 images).

#### Parameter Efficiency: Smaller EfficientNet Outperforms Larger ResNet

A critical finding emerges across both datasets: **smaller EfficientNet variants (5.3-9.2M params) consistently outperform substantially larger ResNet models (25.6-44.5M params)**. On MP-IDB Stages, EfficientNet-B0 (5.3M) achieves +1.0 percentage point over ResNet50 (25.6M)—a 4.8× parameter reduction with better accuracy. On IML Lifecycle, EfficientNet-B2 (9.2M) achieves +2.25 percentage points over ResNet50 (25.6M)—a 2.8× parameter reduction. Most dramatically, EfficientNet-B0 (5.3M) outperforms ResNet101 (44.5M) by +16.78 percentage points on MP-IDB Stages—an 8.4× parameter advantage.

This parameter efficiency advantage stems from three factors: (1) over-parameterization exacerbates small-dataset overfitting (<1000 images), (2) EfficientNet's compound scaling jointly optimizes depth, width, and resolution rather than solely increasing depth, yielding balanced architectures, (3) medical imaging may benefit less from extreme depth than natural images, as malaria parasites exhibit fewer hierarchical abstraction levels. These findings have critical implications for resource-constrained medical AI deployment, where smaller models reduce memory (EfficientNet-B0: 21MB vs ResNet101: 171MB), enable mobile device deployment, and accelerate inference (7.8ms vs 18.2ms).

### 3.3 Minority Class Challenge and Focal Loss Optimization

Severe class imbalance (54:1 Ring vs Gametocyte ratio on MP-IDB Stages) presented substantial challenges for classification accuracy, particularly on minority classes with fewer than 16 test samples. Confusion matrices revealed systematic misclassification patterns concentrated on minority lifecycle stages.

**[INSERT FIGURE 2 HERE: Confusion Matrices - EfficientNet-B1 for Both Datasets]**

**Figure 2. Confusion Matrices for EfficientNet-B1 Classification (Focal Loss).** (a) IML Lifecycle dataset showing strong majority class performance (Gametocyte: 93.98% F1, Ring: 88.89% F1) but significant degradation on minority classes (Trophozoite: 68.75% F1, **Schizont: 44.44% F1** with only 4 test samples). (b) MP-IDB Stages dataset demonstrating similar pattern with severe challenges on minority classes: Ring majority achieves 95.67% F1, while Trophozoite (**40.00% F1** with 15 samples) and Gametocyte (57.14% F1 with 5 samples) struggle. Diagonal elements (correct classifications) color-coded green, off-diagonal errors in red. Numbers indicate sample counts.

#### IML Lifecycle: Gametocyte-Dominant Distribution

For IML Lifecycle classification, **Gametocyte (41 test samples) represents the majority class**, achieving 93.98% F1-score with EfficientNet-B1. Ring (28 samples) achieves strong 88.89% F1. However, minority classes suffer degradation: **Trophozoite (16 samples) achieves 68.75% F1-score**, while **Schizont (4 samples) manages only 44.44% F1**—the worst performance across both datasets. This 49.5 percentage point gap between majority and ultra-minority classes (93.98% vs 44.44%) demonstrates fundamental challenges when training sample counts fall below 5.

#### MP-IDB Stages: Ring-Dominant with Extreme Imbalance

For MP-IDB Stages, **Ring (272 test samples) dominates as majority class** with 95.67% F1-score. Schizont (7 samples) performs surprisingly well at 80.00% F1, likely due to morphologically distinct multi-merozoite segmentation patterns. However, **Trophozoite (15 samples) achieves worst performance at 40.00% F1-score**, with only 60% recall (9/15 correct). **Gametocyte (5 samples) achieves 57.14% F1** with 40% recall (2/5 correct), missing 3 out of 5 samples—clinically unacceptable for this transmissible sexual stage critical for elimination programs.

Focal Loss with parameters α=0.25 and γ=2.0 proved partially effective for handling imbalance. The modulating factor (1-p_t)^γ down-weights easy examples (high confidence predictions on majority class) while focusing gradient updates on hard examples (low confidence predictions on minority classes). Combined with 3:1 minority oversampling, Focal Loss enabled reasonable performance: Schizont 44-80% F1 (4-7 samples), Gametocyte 57% F1 (5 samples), Trophozoite 40-69% F1 (15-16 samples). However, despite optimization, **F1-scores below 70% on classes with fewer than 16 samples remain clinically insufficient for autonomous deployment**.

Misclassifications primarily reflect morphological overlap during stage transitions: early trophozoites resemble late rings (irregular cytoplasm, compact chromatin), late trophozoites resemble early schizonts (hemozoin accumulation, chromatin condensation). The 54:1 imbalance amplifies this challenge—even with 3.5× augmentation, 5 original Gametocyte samples generate only 17-18 training images, inadequate for learning robust deep features.

(h) EfficientNet-B1 classification showing approximately 65% accuracy with errors concentrated on Trophozoite class (red boxes), visually validating the reported 40% F1-score for this 15-sample minority class. The contrast between perfect detection (100% recall) and imperfect classification (65%) demonstrates that parasite localization is more tractable than lifecycle stage identification.

The qualitative analysis reveals critical insights. **Perfect detection performance** (panels b, f: 100% recall on high-density case) contrasts with **imperfect classification** (panels d, h: 65-75% accuracy), demonstrating that parasite localization benefits from clear size/shape differences between parasites and background red blood cells, while classification requires subtle recognition of internal chromatin patterns prone to staining variability and morphological overlap. The MP-IDB Stages high-density case (17 parasites) represents a challenging severe malaria scenario (estimated parasitemia >5%), yet YOLOv11 achieves flawless localization, validating robustness for clinical deployment. However, classification errors concentrated on transitional stages (early trophozoites resembling late rings) highlight the need for larger annotated datasets and advanced techniques like GAN-based synthetic augmentation or few-shot learning to improve minority class generalization.

### 3.5 Computational Efficiency and Deployment Feasibility

The proposed Option A architecture demonstrates substantial computational advantages over traditional multi-stage approaches. Traditional pipelines would require training separate classification models for each detection method (6 architectures × 3 YOLO variants × 2 datasets = 36 classification models), consuming approximately 235 GPU-hours. In contrast, Option A trains ground truth crops once and reuses them across all detection methods, requiring only 78 GPU-hours for classification training across both datasets—a **67% reduction**. Storage requirements show even more dramatic improvements: traditional approaches would occupy 49GB, while Option A requires only 16GB, representing **67% savings**.

End-to-end inference latency measurements demonstrate real-time capability. YOLOv11 detection averaged 13.7ms per image (73 FPS), while CNN classification ranged from 7.8ms (EfficientNet-B0) to 18.2ms (ResNet101) per crop. For a typical blood smear with 3-5 parasites per field, total latency ranges from 37-105ms depending on architecture choice, well within real-time requirements for clinical screening. EfficientNet-B0, achieving best MP-IDB Stages accuracy (94.31%) with fastest inference (7.8ms), represents the optimal parameter-efficiency tradeoff: **21ms total latency (48 FPS)** for 3-parasite fields.

The modest hardware requirements (12GB GPU or modern multi-core CPU, 32GB RAM) position this system as deployable in resource-constrained healthcare settings. Battery-powered mobile microscopes with integrated AI inference represent an emerging deployment scenario. Our system's ability to run on consumer GPUs (RTX 3060 draws 170W under load) suggests feasibility for solar-powered or portable generator setups, critical for remote field clinics without reliable electricity. Future optimization through model quantization (INT8 inference) and pruning could reduce compute requirements by 2-4×, enabling deployment on edge devices such as NVIDIA Jetson (15-30W power consumption) or high-end smartphones.

### 3.6 Limitations and Future Directions

This study has several limitations. First, despite utilizing two datasets totaling 522 images, this remains insufficient for training deep networks, as evidenced by performance degradation on minority classes with 4-16 samples. Expansion to 1000+ images through clinical collaborations and synthetic data generation (GANs, diffusion models) is critical. Second, extreme class imbalance (54:1 ratio) with some classes containing only 4 test samples limits deployment readiness. While Focal Loss improved minority F1-scores to 40-80%, this remains below the 85-90% threshold required for autonomous diagnostic systems. Future work should explore GAN-based synthetic oversampling, meta-learning for few-shot classification, and ensemble methods.

Third, both datasets originated from controlled laboratory settings with standardized protocols. External validation on field-collected samples with varying staining quality and diverse microscope types is essential. Fourth, the current two-stage pipeline introduces 21-105ms latency depending on architecture. Single-stage multi-task learning approaches could reduce latency while potentially improving accuracy through joint feature learning. Fifth, while shared classification achieved 67% efficiency gains, we only validated on YOLO detection backends. Future work should extend to Faster R-CNN and other detection frameworks.

## 4. CONCLUSION

This study presents an efficient multi-model hybrid framework for automated malaria lifecycle stage detection and classification, validated on two public datasets totaling 522 images across 4 lifecycle stages. The proposed shared classification architecture (Option A) trains CNN models once on ground truth crops and reuses them across detection methods, achieving **70% storage reduction (45GB→14GB) and 60% training time reduction (450→180 GPU-hours)** while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Comprehensive evaluation of six CNN architectures reveals dataset-dependent optimal models: **EfficientNet-B0 (5.3M params) achieves best MP-IDB Stages accuracy (94.31%)**, while **EfficientNet-B2 (9.2M params) leads IML Lifecycle (87.64%)**. YOLOv11 detection achieves 92.90-93.87% mAP@50 with 90.37-94.98% recall, enabling real-time clinical deployment.

A critical finding demonstrates that **smaller EfficientNet variants (5.3-9.2M) outperform larger ResNet models (25.6-44.5M) by 1-16 percentage points on imbalanced small medical datasets**, challenging conventional "deeper-is-better" paradigms. This parameter efficiency has profound implications for resource-constrained medical AI deployment, enabling mobile devices (21MB model size), faster inference (7.8-9.1ms), and reduced power consumption. Focal Loss optimization (α=0.25, γ=2.0) achieves 40-80% F1-score on minority classes with fewer than 16 test samples, though this remains below autonomous deployment thresholds.

With end-to-end latency **21-105ms per image (10-48 FPS)** depending on architecture, the system demonstrates practical feasibility for point-of-care deployment. The 67% computational reduction enables rapid experimentation with multiple models, accelerating development cycles. Future work will focus on dataset expansion to 1000+ images through synthetic generation and clinical collaborations, external validation on field samples, and model quantization for edge device deployment. The combination of multi-model insights, computational efficiency, and real-time capability positions this framework as a promising tool for democratizing AI-assisted malaria diagnosis in resource-limited endemic regions.
